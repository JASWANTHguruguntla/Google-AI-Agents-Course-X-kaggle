Drug discovery is one of the most transformative areas where AI is making significant inroads. The \"new developments\" aren't usually a single, massive breakthrough, but rather a continuous stream of advancements that are making the process faster, more efficient, and more successful.\n\nHere are some of the key areas of new developments in AI-driven drug discovery:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **AI for Genomics and Proteomics:** AI algorithms are becoming incredibly adept at analyzing massive genomic and proteomic datasets to identify novel disease targets (genes or proteins that are implicated in a disease and can be targeted by a drug). This moves beyond what was previously feasible with manual analysis.\n*   **Network Biology Analysis:** AI can model complex biological networks to understand how different molecules interact. This helps researchers identify key nodes within these networks that, when targeted, could have a significant therapeutic effect.\n\n**2. Novel Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI Models (e.g., GANs, VAEs):** These models are revolutionizing de novo drug design. Instead of screening existing libraries, AI can *generate* entirely new molecular structures with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, solubility, low toxicity). This is a game-changer for exploring chemical space.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning for Molecule Optimization:** Once a promising molecule is designed, reinforcement learning can be used to iteratively refine its structure to improve its efficacy, safety, and other desirable characteristics.\n*   **Predictive Modeling for Properties:** AI models are getting better at predicting crucial properties of a potential drug molecule, such as its ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) profile, *before* it's synthesized and tested in the lab. This significantly reduces the number of costly and time-consuming experimental validations needed.\n\n**3. Enhanced Pre-clinical and Clinical Trial Design:**\n\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI can analyze historical clinical trial data, patient characteristics, and drug properties to predict the likelihood of success for a new drug candidate in clinical trials. This helps pharmaceutical companies prioritize their investments.\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can identify specific patient subpopulations who are most likely to respond to a particular drug. This leads to more targeted and efficient clinical trials, potentially with smaller sample sizes and higher success rates.\n*   **Synthetic Data Generation:** In cases where real patient data is scarce or sensitive, AI can generate realistic synthetic data that can be used for training models or simulating trial outcomes.\n\n**4. Drug Repurposing and Combination Therapies:**\n\n*   **AI for Finding New Uses for Existing Drugs:** By analyzing vast amounts of biological and clinical data, AI can identify existing drugs that might be effective against different diseases. This is a faster and cheaper route to new therapies than developing a drug from scratch.\n*   **Optimizing Combination Therapies:** AI can analyze complex interactions between drugs to identify synergistic combinations that are more effective than single agents, especially for diseases like cancer that often develop resistance to single treatments.\n\n**5. AI-Powered Platforms and Companies:**\n\nNumerous companies are emerging or expanding their AI capabilities in drug discovery. Some notable examples of companies and initiatives that are at the forefront include:\n\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Uses AI to analyze biological images and discover new drug targets and therapies.\n*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on using AI to design novel drug candidates.\n*   **BenevolentAI:** Leverages AI and machine learning to accelerate drug discovery and development.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery.\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** A prominent player in AI-driven drug discovery and development, known for its end-to-end AI platform.\n\n**Key Trends and What to Watch For:**\n\n*   **Increased Integration:** AI is no longer a standalone tool but is becoming deeply integrated into every stage of the drug discovery pipeline.\n*   **\"In Silico\" to \"In Vivo\" Bridging:** The focus is on improving the translation of AI-generated insights from computer simulations to real-world biological experiments and clinical trials.\n*   **Democratization of Drug Discovery:** AI tools are starting to become more accessible to smaller biotech companies and academic researchers.\n*   **Emphasis on Explainability:** While generating novel molecules is impressive, there's a growing need for AI models that can explain *why* they propose a particular molecule or target.\n\nIn essence, AI is moving drug discovery from a process of trial-and-error to a more predictive, rational, and efficient endeavor. This has the potential to bring much-needed treatments to patients faster and at a lower cost.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which was:\n\n**2. Novel Molecule Design and Optimization**\n\nThis area is incredibly exciting because it's about AI actively *creating* new potential medicines, rather than just analyzing existing data. Here's a deeper dive into the advancements within this development:\n\n**a) Generative AI Models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) for De Novo Drug Design:**\n\n*   **What they are:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are types of neural networks that learn the underlying distribution of data and can then generate new data that resembles the original. In drug discovery, they learn the \"rules\" of chemistry and molecular structures.\n*   **How they're used:**\n    *   **Learning Chemical Space:** These models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules. They learn the valid arrangements of atoms, bond types, and chemical structures that are typically found in successful drugs.\n    *   **Generating New Molecules:** Once trained, they can be prompted to generate entirely new molecular structures. This isn't just randomly combining atoms; the models aim to create molecules that are chemically valid and possess desired characteristics.\n    *   **Target-Specific Generation:** A key advancement is guiding these generative models to design molecules that are specifically predicted to bind to a particular disease target (e.g., a protein involved in cancer cell growth). This can be done by incorporating information about the target's structure into the generation process.\n    *   **Exploring Uncharted Territory:** Traditional drug discovery often relies on modifying existing drug scaffolds or screening vast libraries of known compounds. Generative AI can explore entirely novel chemical spaces that human chemists might not have conceived of, leading to potentially breakthrough drug candidates.\n\n**b) Reinforcement Learning for Molecule Optimization:**\n\n*   **What it is:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make a sequence of decisions by trying to maximize a reward. Think of a robot learning to walk by taking steps and getting rewarded for moving forward.\n*   **How it's used:**\n    *   **Iterative Refinement:** Once a generative model produces a promising initial molecule, RL can be used to \"fine-tune\" it. The RL agent can make small modifications to the molecule (e.g., adding or changing a functional group) and receive a \"reward\" based on how those changes improve its predicted properties.\n    *   **Balancing Multiple Objectives:** This is crucial. A drug needs to be effective, but also safe, absorbable, and metabolizable. RL can be trained to optimize for multiple criteria simultaneously, finding molecules that strike the best balance between these competing needs.\n    *   **\"Automated Medicinal Chemistry\":** In a way, RL acts like an automated medicinal chemist, intelligently exploring variations around a lead compound to discover the optimal version.\n\n**c) Predictive Modeling for Properties (ADMET, etc.):**\n\n*   **What it is:** These are AI models (often deep learning models) trained to predict specific physicochemical and biological properties of a molecule *without* needing to synthesize and test it in the lab.\n*   **How they're used:**\n    *   **Early Filtering:** As soon as a potential molecule is designed (by humans or generative AI), these predictive models can quickly assess its likelihood of having poor ADMET properties. If a molecule is predicted to be highly toxic or poorly absorbed, it can be discarded early, saving significant time and resources.\n    *   **Guiding Design:** These models also provide feedback to generative AI or human designers, indicating which modifications would likely improve the molecule's ADMET profile.\n    *   **Beyond ADMET:** Predictive models are also used for other critical properties like solubility, stability, and even potential off-target interactions.\n\n**Why this is a \"New Development\":**\n\nWhile early computational chemistry existed, the advent of deep learning and advanced AI techniques has significantly amplified the capabilities in molecule design and optimization. We're moving from:\n\n*   **Screening and Modification** to **De Novo Design and Generation**.\n*   **Predicting individual properties** to **optimizing for a complex set of properties simultaneously**.\n*   **Slow, iterative chemical intuition** to **rapid, AI-guided exploration of vast chemical spaces**.\n\nThis allows researchers to explore entirely new classes of molecules that might be more effective and have fewer side effects, potentially leading to breakthroughs in treating diseases that are currently difficult to manage.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven novel molecule design and optimization is rapidly evolving.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
